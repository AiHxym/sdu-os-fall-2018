# Work Progress of Synthetic Dream

## Week 5

Successfully compiled linux0.11.
Running linux0.11 in different emulators (Bochs,QEMU,VirtualBox,etc.).
Finding appropriate method to debug linux0.11.

## Week 6

Debug linux0.11 in multiple linux distributions (debian fedora opensuse archlinux) using multiple version of gdb (4 6 7 8).
Using multiple ways to debug linux0.11(different gdb guies,gdb cmdline frontends,pure gdb cmdline).

Finally choose an appropriate debuging method.

Successfully set up work environment using VMWare.
(Debian9.5+LXDE+gcc6+Bochs+Nemiver+gdbgui)
(OpenSUSE Tumbleweed+LXQt+gcc8+Bochs+Qt Designer)

Shared work environment to partner, ensuring predictable result.

## Week7

Come out a data extraction method using gdb debugger.

Initial work of gdb output.

Will now writting the code of the gdb output filter.

## Week8

Complete the data extraction tools. Pack it into a VMWare virtual machine.

Now we are discussing which and what part of debugging infomation should be extracetd.

## Week9

Optimize the data extraction tools for easier use. 
Write a simple documention for it.

Fully tested the data extraction tools with partner. Fix some bugs.

Now we are discussing which and what part of debugging infomation should be extracetd.

## Week10

Extracting data.

Inproving data extraction tools.

## Week11

Extracting data.

Make data extraction tools more easy to use.

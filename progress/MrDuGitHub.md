# Work Progress of Mr.d

## 5th Week

<font face="" size="4" color="">

In this week, we read the chapter on the file system carefully in the book *A Heavily Commented Linux Kernal Source Code--Linux Version 0.11*.  
We figure out how a file was created and closed in the Linux 0.11, and tracked the function call in this process. The same things were done with the write and save operation. We are basically clear about the data structures required for visualization in the source code.  
Next week we will read the source code at a deeper level, detailing the events we will visualize and the various elements in them, and present them in the form of drawings.  
The source files involved are listed as follows:  

* open.c
* namei.c
* read_write.c
* block_dev.c
* hd.c

## 6th Week

### Conclusion
* Initially determined design plan.
* Read the source code mentioned last week, determine the data structure to be visualized 
* Based on the work of the seniors last year, a temporary experimental environment was set up to confirm the authenticity of our design
* Part of the data was collected for drawing and display
* Draw pictures of our basic module,including the overall presentation of the file system and create, write and close files

### Next step
* Rebuild an experimental platform for better data collection 
* Extend the base module
	* Such as the buffer and inode sections 
	* Exploring how the file system works when accessing other types of files because we currently only consider ordinary files
* Maybe we should start to consider the tool for the final presentation 

## 7th Week

###	Conclusion
* Rebuild the experimental platform to support vi
* Try and add a system call for fixing some bugs 
* Data collection

### Next step
* Unfinished part of the plan last week
* Data collection


## 8th Week

###	Conclusion
* Collect data of create file and open file
* Try the processing and cocos2d for Visualization
* Design the corresponding scene based on the extracted data

### Next step
* Data collection
* Visualization

## 9th Week

###	Conclusion
* Rebuild the code repository with branches;create the basic branch for the next data extraction;create the close and write branches
* Confirme the processing as a visualization tool and learned its basic usage.

### Next step
* Visualization

## 10th Week

###	Conclusion
* Extract static data of the file system
* Build a processing-based animation production framework,and based on this,the initial scene and some static display were drawn.

### Next step
* Visualization,visualization and visualization

## 11th Week

###	Conclusion
* Make a little animation
* Organize and filter data
* Prepare for the presentation of the extracted data
### Next step
* Visualization,visualization and visualization


## 12th Week

###	Conclusion
* Finish the animation of static presentation
### Next step
* Visualization,visualization and visualization


## 13th Week

###	Conclusion
* Make the animation of create and open files,
### Next step
* finish it.

# Work Progress of Mr.d

## 5th Week

<font face="" size="4" color="">

In this week, we read the chapter on the file system carefully in the book *A Heavily Commented Linux Kernal Source Code--Linux Version 0.11*.  
We figure out how a file was created and closed in the Linux 0.11, and tracked the function call in this process. The same things were done with the write and save operation. We are basically clear about the data structures required for visualization in the source code.  
Next week we will read the source code at a deeper level, detailing the events we will visualize and the various elements in them, and present them in the form of drawings.  
The source files involved are as follows:  

* open.c
* namei.c
* read_write.c
* block_dev.c
* hd.c
